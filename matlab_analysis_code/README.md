# light-and-the-mPFC-code
Code used in the "Prefrontal cortex neurons encode ambient light intensity differentially across regions and layers" paper.
We are currently working on a more thorough documentation of the code.
Please contact the leading author, Mr. Elyashiv Zangen (elyashiv.zangen@mail.huji.ac.il), if you have any questions about the code or if you intend using it.
A part of the analyzed dataset (‘experiment_data.7z’), to be used in testing the code, can be found in Figshare (https://figshare.com/s/cf9dd54f122789dcd4a5?file=42059829). The analysis run time for this part of the dataset is expected to be 3 hours.
The complete dataset used in this study will be available upon publication.
